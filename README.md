# Text-Scrapper-using-Mongo_DB

Text scrapper is used extract reviews from Flipkart based on the user input.

This is  a web application, it takes product name from user as a input and fetch the reviews and display to the User.

If user enters the wrong prodcut name, it displays mesaage on console.

I have used Mongo DB to store data in data base. if user entered input is already present in database then it fetch from database else it goes to Flipkart site and takes reviews and display to user aswell store into data base.
