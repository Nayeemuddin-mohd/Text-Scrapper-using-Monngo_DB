iphone,Flipkart Customer,5,Worth every penny,It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use : internet connected always with 4g Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome. ...
iphone,muddassar shaikh,5,Highly recommended,iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.Cameras are awesome: battery backup excellent: great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !
